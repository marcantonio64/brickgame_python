Brick Game with tkinter
=======================

This package contains the implementation of a client with some simple
games. The user will find:

* A selector interface
* A snake game
* A breakout game
* An asteroids game
* A tetris game
* A High Scores screen

All these elements were built using `Block` objects as pixels in a
20x10 grid environment.
